# Description
# Power method for calculating second largest eigenvalue of a sparse matrix.
# The motivation for this is to replace the current algorithm that I use in my
# expander graph generating algorithms for calculating eigenvalues - the current
# algorithm is too slow for the purpose of the project. Also, it does not take
# advantage of the sparse matrices that the expander generating algorithm creates.

# Disclaimer (Rights of ownership): This is a Python implementation of the power method
# described in Kevin Chang's unpublished thesis (Princeton) - his implementation is done in C.
